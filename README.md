# Installation
```git clone https://github.com/mryes2020/simple_chatbot_python```<br></br>
*then setup a sql database and enter your sql credentials in the bot.py file - line 16*<br></br>
*then start the program and do some training first by choosing the option 1 and inserting a conversation example in there*<br></br>
*example conversation is already in the training_/ folder !! make sure to use the same syntax when making your own conversation file*<br></br>

# Conversation File Syntax
The syntax is simple..<br></br>
[question from the person1]<br></br>
[answer from the person2]<br></br>
[question from the person1]<br></br>
[answer from the person2]<br></br>
[question from the person1]<br></br>
[answer from the person2]<br></br>
tho there are not only 6 lines you can fit into that file, this was just an example..<br></br>
the conversation file can have an unlimited (even of course) number of lines
